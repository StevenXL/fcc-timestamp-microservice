# FreeCodeCamp - Timestamp Microservice
This repository contains a small full-stack Javascript web application.

This was done in order to complete the [timestamp microservice
challenge](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/timestamp-microservice) from
[FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com).

This repository will return a JSON representation of the unix timestamp and
natural date, given a proper query string to the `/` endpoint.
